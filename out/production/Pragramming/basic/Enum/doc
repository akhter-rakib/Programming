Enum in java is a data type that contains fixed set of constants.
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma.
Note that they should be in uppercase letters:
Points to remember for Java Enum

enum improves type safety
enum can be easily used in switch
enum can be traversed
enum can have fields, constructors and methods
enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important points of enum :
Every enum internally implemented by using Class.
/* internally above enum Color is converted to
class Color
{    public static final Color RED = new Color();
     public static final Color BLUE = new Color();
     public static final Color GREEN = new Color();
}*/
Every enum constant represents an object of type enum.
enum type can be passed as an argument to switch statement.
