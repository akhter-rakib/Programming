Facade Design Pattern :
facade means face of building(building ar ar face but building ar vitore ki ase seta jani na ) .. The people
walking past the road can only see this glass face of the building.
They do not know anything about it, the wiring, the pipes and other complexities. It hides all the complexities
of the building and displays a friendly face.
Another good example can be the startup of a computer. When a computer starts up, it involves the work of cpu,
memory, hard drive, etc. To make it easy to use for users, we can add a facade which wrap the complexity of
the task, and provide one simple interface instead.

> provide unified(somonnit) interface to a set of interface(s) in a subsystem
