Where the Python, R, Scala used 10 lines of code there java used 100 line of code because they are functional programming language.
Concise  code = write less code instead of N number of code.
python, scala support functional programming.
Other are procedure programming , functional programming where java is OOP.
main purpose of Lambda expression is to enable functional programming in java.
A function we can handle just like object by lambda.In general mathematics term lambda came in 1930...

Java 8 features
1. Lambda Expressions
2. Functional Interface
3. Default methods and static methods
4. Predefined Functional Interfaces
   Predicate
   function
   Consumer
   supplier
   etc
5. Double colon Operator (::)
   Method reference
   Constructor reference
6. Stream
7. Date and Time Api
8. Optional class
9. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
10.etc

Lisp is the first programming language where lambda is used first.
Its very unfortunate that lambda came in java after Ruby, python, C, C++, Scala. Because Java People was Ego for function programming
because they was proud only for t the OOP
Main Objective Of lambda Expression is : To bring benefit of functional Programming in Java.
