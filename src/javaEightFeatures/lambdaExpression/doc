It represent one method interface using an expression.
It is very useful in collection library. It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.
Java lambda expression is treated as a function, so compiler does not create .class file.

Functional Interface :
Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface. An interface which has only one abstract method
is called functional interface.
Java provides an anotation @FunctionalInterface, which is used to declare an interface as functional interface.

Why use Lambda Expression
1. To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
2. Less coding.
