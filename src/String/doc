 In java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. An array
of characters works same as java string. For example:
In java, string objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.
Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.

Why string objects are immutable in java?
Because java uses the concept of string literal.Suppose there are 5 reference variables,
all refers to one object "sachin".If one reference variable changes the value of the object,
it will be affected to all the reference variables. That is why string objects are immutable in java.

What is mutable string
A string that can be modified or changed is known as mutable string. StringBuffer and StringBuilder
classes are used for creating mutable string.

SubString ?
A part of string is called substring. In other words, substring is a subset of another string.
In case of substring startIndex is inclusive and endIndex is exclusive.
