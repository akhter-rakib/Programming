If we want to retrieve obj one by one from the collection then we should go for cursor
There are three types of cursor
 1.Enumaration=for legacy example vector interface
 2.Iterator= universal curosr.only forword towards traverse
 3.ListIterator = can forword and towards traverse
 Here Iterator is the unversal cursor
 But Iterator can only traverse in the towards forword direction
 it is single direction cursor and only can read and remove but can not replace
