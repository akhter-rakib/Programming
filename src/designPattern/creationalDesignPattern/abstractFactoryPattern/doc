 Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related
    (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a
    class returns a factory of classes. So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher
    than the Factory Pattern.

 An Abstract Factory Pattern is also known as Kit.

 In other words ->
    Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
    This factory is also called as factory of factories.
    In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of
    related objects without explicitly specifying their classes.
