Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input,
we need to return one of the sub-class object. This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation
of a class from client program to the factory class.
Super class in factory design pattern can be an interface, abstract class or a normal java class. For
our factory design pattern example, we have abstract super class with overridden toString() method for
testing purpose.
