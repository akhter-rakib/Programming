 Def: For any java class if  we  allow to create only one object/instance such type of class is called Singleton class
  Example :
   1. Runtime(Java Runtime class is used to interact with java runtime environment. Java Runtime class provides
      methods to execute a process, invoke GC, get total and free memory in JVM etc),
      So By Runtime object we can communicate with JVM
   2. Business servicelotor etc
      Advanced of Singleton class

what is the need of Singleton object? Advantage class of singleClass
if several people have same requirement then it is not
requirement to create a separate object for every requirement. so for this causes
 - performance and memory utilise is the main reason for Singleton
 - Here run time a sob object akta object ar memory share kore thake

Way to Create Single class
Approach One : private static className var = new ClassName; under The CLass So that In the Run time It will create a Obj
 for EveryRequest
Approach Two : Private static CLassName var =null;
 When the first request comes then It will create the obj and after that other will reuse this obj
Runtime class is internally implemented using the first way(Look the exmp : SingleTonCLassWayOne) of create singleton class.

Do you know what is the main Use of private constructor ?:
> Private constructor main use is to create singleton class.

kono class k final declare korle setar ar child class(oi class k kau extends korte pare na) create kora jai na but
jodi class is not final then kivabe child class child class create kora protect kora jabe ?
ans:oi mother class ar constructor k private kore dite hobe :)
