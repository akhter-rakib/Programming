Hash code is nothing but address of the object. most people ans it.
But hashCode can not represent address of a object.
If the above is true then ans the following two. plz
is it possible to override hashcode? yes
is it possible to override address of a object ? No
So HashCode and Address both are same ? No
In java it is impossible to know address of a object because java language is
programmer friendly language .Not machine friendly language. C, c++ machine friendly language

What is hashCode ?
For every obj a unique Integer number will be generated by jvm which is nothing but hashCode.

What is the need of hashCode ?
JVM will use hashCode while saving obj into into hashing related data Structure just like hashTable,
hashMap, hashSet etc.

Each object will be added base on hashCode
If every object is save base on hashCode then Search Operation will be Easy.
Number one Search algorithm is hashing.
1.Liner Search -> linearly(one by one) we have to compare to search a value in this linear search
                  complexity : 0(n) it is simplest but worst search
2.Binary Search -> first we need to sort it
                   then we need to divide it
                   Complexity : o(log2 ^n)
3.Hashing Search -> In this search system it want to know what is hashCode and search it in the
                    HashTable(bucket)
                    complexity : 0(1)

Main Advantage of saving object base on hashCode is Search operation become easy
Most powerful search algorithm is hashing
If we can not keep hashCode method we can use Object class hashCode method
 public native int hashCode()//it is located into Object Class
 Object class hashCode method will generate hashCode base on address of object only.
 It does not mean that hashCode represent Address of a Object . It will take the Address to
 generate for example :
 hashCode = (object address*3*7/3.7) //it is just a demo
