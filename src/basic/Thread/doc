For each program, a Main thread is created by JVM(Java Virtual Machine).
The “Main” thread first verifies the existence of the main() method, and then it initializes the class.
Note that from JDK 6, main() method is mandatory in a standalone java application.




Deadlocking with use of Main Thread(only single thread)
We can create a deadlock by just using Main thread, i.e.
by just using a single thread. The following java program demonstrate this.
Explanation :
The statement “Thread.currentThread().join()”, will tell Main thread to wait for this thread(i.e. wait for itself) to die.
Thus Main thread wait for itself to die, which is nothing but a deadlock
