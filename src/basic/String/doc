String is immutable.
StringBuilder is mutable.
StringBuffer is similar to StringBuilder except one difference that StringBuffer is thread safe.
When to use which one :

If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program, then use String class object because
A String object is immutable.
If a string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string)
and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.
If a string can change, and will be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer
because StringBuffer is synchronous so you have thread-safety.
Objects of String are immutable, and objects of StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable.
StringBuffer and StringBuilder are similar, but StringBuilder is faster and preferred over StringBuffer
for single threaded program. If thread safety is needed, then StringBuffer is used.

//Important
Mutability Difference:

String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created,
whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.

Thread-Safety Difference:

The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuffer is thread-safe.
So when the application needs to be run only in a single thread then it is better to use StringBuilder.
StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.

Situations:
If your string is not going to change use a String class because a String object is immutable.
If your string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string)
and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.
If your string can change, and will be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer because
StringBuffer is synchronous so you have thread-safety.
Single Tread Hole ==StringBuilder
Multiple Tread hole == StringBuffer

What is String in java ?
Generally, string is a sequence of characters. But in java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters.
The java.lang.String class is used to create string object.
There are two ways to create String object:
1.By string literal
2.By new keyword
