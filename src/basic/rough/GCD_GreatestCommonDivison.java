/*Java program to demonstrate How to find Greatest Common Divisor or GCD of
        * two numbers using Euclidâ€™s method.*/
/*
Let' take an example of calculating GCD of 54 and 24 using Euclid's algorithm. Here X = 54 and Y = 24,
        since Y is not zero we move to the logical part and assign X = Y, which means X becomes 24 and Y
        becomes 54%24 i.e 6. Since Y is still not zero, we again apply the logic. This times X will become
        6 and Y will become 24%6 i.e. Y=0. Bingo, Y is now zero which means we have our answer
        and it's nothing but the value of X which is 6 (six).
